FIELDS (all required, parsed deterministically by the grader):

  recommended         one of: tasks | parallel_for
  measured_tasks_s    YOUR measured time (s) for the tasks variant at the highest
                      thread count, taken from your own `perf-results-a2.json`.
                      The grader cross-checks this value against your committed
                      `perf-results-a2.json` (within 5%) — NOT against the
                      canonical re-run.
  measured_for_s      YOUR measured time (s) for the parallel_for variant.
  justification_keyword   required ONLY if `recommended` is NOT the variant your
                          OWN data shows as faster. Must be one of (exact string):
                            - irregular_load_balance
                            - scales_better_at_128T
                            - simpler_to_maintain
                            - future_proof_for_dynamic_work
                          If you recommend the variant your data shows as
                          faster, leave this blank or delete the line.

The grader awards full CHOICE marks if your recommendation matches the variant
that your own committed `perf-results-a2.json` shows as faster. If you recommend
the slower variant and supply a defensible keyword, you also receive full marks.
Either variant can be the right answer — the test is whether the recommendation
follows your own measured evidence.

The canonical re-run is NOT consulted for CHOICE grading. (It is used separately
for the perf-component score against the published `T_ref` times.)

## Justification (≤ 200 words)

Explain your recommendation in plain English. This text is not auto-scored, but it's what the instructor reads when spot-checking and what you get credit for via the REFLECTION-prompt route.

I recommend `parallel_for` for this submission because it was the fastest variant in my own CX3 measurements at the higher thread counts that matter most for the final comparison. At 128 threads, `parallel_for` ran in 0.0756 s, while `tasks` took 0.0802 s. The same pattern also appeared at 64 threads, where `parallel_for` was again faster.

My interpretation is that this Mandelbrot region is irregular enough that dynamic scheduling helps, but not irregular enough for explicit task creation to repay its extra runtime overhead. In my implementation, `parallel_for` already uses dynamic scheduling and reduction, so it gets useful load balancing with less scheduling and synchronisation cost than the task-based version. Tasks were competitive at low and medium thread counts, but the simpler worksharing variant delivered the best measured high-thread performance on my benchmark runs.
